# Amazing-Numpy

## INTRODUCTION
Notebooks in this repository are to highlight amazing functions available within numpy module which can play a crucial role in any data analysis or machine learning project. 
I am a regular reader of MEDIUM and especially enjoy all data science related articles there. This repository is an effort to pull together all good things
that I could find on NUMPY module at one place. 

### Amazing Numpy Functions [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AD1985/Amazing-Numpy/blob/master/Amazing%20Numpy.ipynb)

* argpartition
* allclose
* clip
* extract
* where
* percentile
* argmin, argmax, argsort
* intersect1d
* hstack, vstack
* linspace

### Implementing Logistic Regression [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AD1985/Amazing-Numpy/blob/master/Implementing_LogistcRegression.ipynb)

In this, I have tried to implement logistic regression algorithm from scratch using only Numpy module to explain the most necessary and crucial steps of any machine learning algorithm.

### Principle Component Analysis (using Numpy) [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AD1985/Amazing-Numpy/blob/master/PCA_with_Numpy.ipynb)

This notebook explains an easy way to understand concepts or principle component and also provides a fast way to calculating principle components for a simple IRIS data.
